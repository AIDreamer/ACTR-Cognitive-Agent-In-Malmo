;;; To do       : [X] Consider making a module for this to allow configuration
;;;             :     of the display (colors, widths, restricted productions, 
;;;             :     etc) and provide a simple parameter switch to enable.
;;;             : [ ] Draw the links "better" with respect to crossing and
;;;             :     overlapping.

;;; ----- History -----
;;; 2008.08.06 Dan
;;;             : * Initial creation.
;;; 2008.08.06 Dan
;;;             : * Making it a module and doing some optimizing on how it
;;;             :   stores/creates the data to send because it can't handle 
;;;             :   long runs (zbrodoff tutorial model often results in an
;;;             :   allocation error).
;;; 2008.08.07 Dan
;;;             : * Another stability improvement.  It now breaks the grid
;;;             :   up into smaller updates to send over to the environment
;;;             :   to avoid having to create one very large string.  Slows
;;;             :   down the displaying, but shouldn't result in any allocation
;;;             :   issues.
;;; 2008.08.12 Dan
;;;             : * Added the :p-history-colors parameter to allow one to
;;;             :   change the colors used in the grid.
;;; 2011.10.28 Dan [1.1]
;;;             : * Adding a different display option for the data - a directed
;;;             :   graph with the productions as nodes and where a link from A->B 
;;;             :   indicates that B was in the conflict set after A fired.
;;;             : * Changed the name of the function used by the previous display
;;;             :   to production-history-chart-data since the new tool is actually
;;;             :   a graph.
;;;             : * Added parameters for some minor control over the graph display.
;;; 2011.11.17 Dan
;;;             : * Added support for another display option in the history graph:
;;;             :   "Frequencies" which draws the links with widths based on thier
;;;             :   relative frequencies.  The most frequent will be drawn 1/4 of
;;;             :   the x spacing wide and the rest scaled to that (unless all are
;;;             :   the same in which case they're all drawn width 1).
;;; 2011.12.06 Dan
;;;             : * Adding the extra data to the info sent for the graph so that
;;;             :   the tcl side can write out a .dot file for the graph.
;;; 2011.12.07 Dan
;;;             : * Added the command production-transition-graph which prints
;;;             :   a DOT representation of the saved production history data
;;;             :   to the current ACT-R command output stream for the specified
;;;             :   graph type which can be one of :all, :run, :cycle, :unique-run,
;;;             :   or :unique-cycle.  The graphs correspond to those that are 
;;;             :   shown in the environment tool using the corresponding buttons, 
;;;             :   and when there are multiple subgraphs each has its own cluster 
;;;             :   in the output.  This allows one to create the graphs without
;;;             :   without having the environment connected if an external DOT
;;;             :   graph viewer is used instead.  
;;; 2011.12.22 Dan
;;;             : * Added another type of display - utilities.
;;; 2012.02.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added a declare and removed unused variables to clean up 
;;;             :   some load time warnings.
;;; 2012.03.12 Dan
;;;             : * Save both the current utility and the U(n) value for display
;;;             :   in the environment production history viewer info.
;;; 2012.03.22 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the graph display for runs and utilities so that it
;;;             :   doesn't show the unchosen links from the end of one session
;;;             :   to the beginning of the next on the following display (that
;;;             :   is the dashed links from the previous displays red box to the
;;;             :   unchosen competitors for the current display's green box).
;;; 2012.04.27 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with displaying the utility graph when there are
;;;             :   no utility differences.
;;;             : * Added an option for hiding the unused productions in the graph
;;;             :   display.
;;; 2013.01.10 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the environment data cache to an equalp hashtable
;;;             :   since the keys are now a cons of the handler name and the
;;;             :   window to prevent issues with multi-environment settings.
;;; 2015.06.10 Dan
;;;             : * Changed time to use ms instead.
;;; 2016.04.22 Dan
;;;             : * Started work to be able to load saved history info.  First
;;;             :   step is adding a function to get the current data because
;;;             :   that will be used to save current results and since this is
;;;             :   used for two different purposes it basically needs to save
;;;             :   the whole module.
;;; 2016.04.28 Dan
;;;             : * Updating the interface functions to use the stored history
;;;             :   info instead of pulling it from the module directly.
;;;             : * Depricated the :draw-blank-columns parameter.  Only the 
;;;             :   box on the viewer controls that now.
;;;             : * Took the cache table out of the module and made it global
;;;             :   because of the possibility of loading saved data without a
;;;             :   model present.
;;; 2016.05.16 Dan
;;;             : * Send the production text over for the graph display so that
;;;             :   it can be shown in a window since can't rely on opening a 
;;;             :   procedural viewer since saved data may not match current 
;;;             :   assuming there even is a current model.
;;; 2016.05.26 Dan
;;;             : * Send the production name over in the grid column info for
;;;             :   a more detailed whynot output.

;;;
;;; General Docs:
;;; 
;;; Open either of the production history tools, "Production History" or "Production
;;; Graph" before running the model or set the :save-p-history parameter to t in the
;;; model to enable the recording.  Once the model stops running the information
;;; about the productions which were in the conflict set during the run can be
;;; viewed using the tools.
;;; 
;;; For the "History" tool, once the model has run click the "Get history" button 
;;; in the bottom left corner of the production history window.  It will draw a grid 
;;; with the rows being the productions in the model and the columns being the times 
;;; at which a conflict-resolution event occurred.
;;;
;;; The cells in the grid are color coded based on what happened during the 
;;; conflict resolution event at the time indicated for the column.
;;; 
;;; If the production was the one selected the cell will be green.
;;; If the production was in the conflict set, but not selected then the cell
;;; will be orange.
;;; If the production was not in the conflict set then the cell will be red.
;;; If the production did not exist at that time the cell will be white.
;;;
;;; Placing the cursor over a cell will cause some details for that production
;;; during that conflict resolution event to be printed at the bottom of the
;;; window.
;;;
;;; For the green and orange cells it will print the utility value for the
;;; production at that time.  For the red cells it will print the whynot 
;;; information indicating the condition that caused the production to not be
;;; in the conflict set.  There is no extra information to print for a white
;;; cell.
;;;
;;; Clicking on the name of a production in the grid will open a new procedural
;;; viewer dialog with that production selected.
;;;
;;; For the "Graph" tool, after the model has run click one of the 6 buttons 
;;; "All transitions", "Frequencies", "Cycles", "Unique Cycles", "Runs", "Unique Runs" 
;;; or "Utilities" to have the data displayed.  All of the displays are drawn the same 
;;; way and the common features will be described before indicating what differs among
;;;  the button choices.
;;; 
;;; The display will show all of the productions in the model in boxes.  If the
;;; box has a black border then it was selected and fired at some point in the 
;;; model's run.  If it has a gray border then it was not selected and fired.
;;; If there is a green border around a production then it is the first production
;;; which was selected for the currently displayed information, and if it has
;;; a red border then it was the last production selected for the currently displayed
;;; information.
;;;
;;; An arrow from a production A to production B means that production B was in
;;; the conflict set after production A fired.  If the arrow has a solid black line then 
;;; production B was selected and fired after A, but if the arrow has a dashed gray
;;; line then it was not selected and fired.
;;;
;;; Clicking on the name of a production in the grid will open a new procedural
;;; viewer dialog with that production selected.
;;; 
;;; The "All transitions" button shows the data for all production firings over
;;; the entire run of the model.  The "Frequencies" button shows the same data
;;; except that the thickness of the links reflects their relative frequencies.
;;; The most frequent will be 1/4 of :p-history-graph-x wide and the others
;;; scaled appropriately.
;;;
;;; The "Cycles" and "Unique Cycles" buttons show the data broken down into 
;;; cycles which occur in the graph (when a loop is formed by a production
;;; eventually firing again after itself).  The display will show only one
;;; cycle at a time.  The number of cycles which occurred is shown below
;;; the graph and the "-" and "+" buttons can be used to change which cycle
;;; is shown.  For "Cycles" all production firings are shown and the cycles
;;; are displayed in temporal order with the model time for the start and end
;;; displayed at the bottom of the window.  For the "Unique Cycles" it only
;;; shows one instance of each cycle that occurs and no specific time information
;;; is shown.
;;; 
;;; The "Runs" and "Unique Runs" buttons show the data broken down into sections
;;; based on when one of the ACT-R running commands were called.  The display will 
;;; only one "run" at a time.  The number of non-empty runs which occurred is 
;;; shown below the graph and the "-" and "+" buttons can be used to change which run
;;; is shown.  For "Runs" all production firings are shown and the runs
;;; are displayed in temporal order with the model time for the start and end
;;; of the run displayed at the bottom of the window.  For the "Unique Runs" it only
;;; shows one instance of each production graph that occurs in a run and no specific 
;;; time information is shown.
;;;
;;; The "Utilities" button breaks the data down into sections based on when the
;;; model receives a reward.  Each of the production boxes will be the same width
;;; in this display and may have two additional bars displayed within the box.
;;; A blue bar at the top represents the relative utility of that production before 
;;; the reward which ended this section has been applied and a blue bar at the 
;;; bottom represents the relative utility of that production after the reward
;;; has been applied.  The utility values are scaled so that the range between the
;;; minimum utility across all sections and the maximum utility across all sections
;;; can be displayed.  If there is no bottom bar then it means that there was no
;;; reward provided (the last chart may end because the model stopped instead of
;;; because there was a reward provided).

;;; Public API:
;;;
;;; :save-p-history parameter
;;;  Enables the recording of production history for display (default is nil).
;;;
;;; :draw-blank-columns parameter
;;;  When set to t (the default value) all conflict resolution events get drawn
;;;  in the environment tool.  If set to nil then conflict resolution events
;;;  which had a null conflict set don't get drawn.
;;; 
;;; :p-history-colors
;;;  This parameter can be used to change the colors displayed in the grid.
;;;  If it is nil (the default) then the green, orange, and red defaults are 
;;;  used for selected, conflict set, and mismatched respectively.  It can be
;;;  set to a list of 3 values where each value is either a color string or nil.
;;;  A valid color string starts with the character # and is followed by 3, 6,
;;;  9 hex digits.  Those digits represent the components of the color to use
;;;  and specify the Red, Green, and Blue values respectively using the same
;;;  number of bits for each (thus either 8, 16, or 24 bits per color).  An
;;;  example would be "#00F" for blue or "#44DA22" which is the green color 
;;;  used by default.
;;;
;;; :p-history-graph-x
;;;  The horizontal pixel spacing between the production boxes in the "Production
;;;  Graph" tool view.
;;;
;;; :p-history-graph-y
;;;  The vertical pixel spacing between the production boxes in the "Production
;;;  Graph" tool view.
